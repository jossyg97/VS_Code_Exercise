Now that you have VS Code, it's time to connect it to a Git Repository. Navigate to your Github account and create a Git Repository. Call it "VS_Code_Exercise". When creating the repo, select the check box that says "Intialize with a Readme".

Once the repo has been created, click the green button that says "Code" and copy the link that pops up.

Open up a fresh instance of VS Code on your desktop and select "Clone Git Repository". Paste the link you copied in the box that pops up and hit enter.

Once the Git Repo has been successfully cloned, open it, and copy in your file from exercise 1.

Edit the Readme file that will populate and paste in these instructions into the Readme file. Save it.

For you to figure out: stage, add a commit message, commit, and push the changes to your Github Repo.
